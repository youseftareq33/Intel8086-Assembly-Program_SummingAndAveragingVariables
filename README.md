# Intel 8086 Assembly Program for Summing and Averaging Variable-Sized Integer Inputs

The Idea of project: 

1) Prompt the user to input N and the size of the number.

2) Use the input size to determine how many bytes are needed to store each number.   

3) Request inputting the first number, then the second and so on until N numbers are input. 

4) Validate the user's input to ensure that it is a decimal number and within the predetermined size.

5) Convert each input number from a string to a BCD format with the predefined size. 

6) Calculate the summation and average of the numbers.

7) Print the summation and average of the numbers.
